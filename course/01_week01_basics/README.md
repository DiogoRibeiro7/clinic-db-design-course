# Week 01: Denormalized design and anomalies

## Learning goals
- Recognize update, insert, and delete anomalies in a single flat table.
- Explain why repeated data creates inconsistencies.
- Practice writing queries that expose data quality problems.

## Run order
1) shared/reset.sql
2) course/01_week01_basics/schema.sql
3) course/01_week01_basics/seed.sql
4) course/01_week01_basics/exercises.sql

## Deliverables
- course/01_week01_basics/exercises.sql (completed)
- Short written answers for each anomaly question

## Grading criteria
- Tasks completed with correct SQL
- Anomalies clearly identified and explained
- Queries run in correct order
- Output is consistent with the seed data
