# Solutions policy

## Options

Option A: Keep teacher materials only in a private branch.
Option B: Store teacher materials in a separate private repository.

## Recommended approach

Use a branch named "teacher" for solution files (e.g., teacher/ folders). Keep the main branch student-facing only and free of solutions.

## Notes

- Do not merge solution files into main.
- Use PRs from the teacher branch only when content is student-safe.
